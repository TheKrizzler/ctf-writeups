# Solution
## Challenge 1
Once we go a few pages into the challenge we get the first challenge; to find the request to the current website in Burp Suite and find the code in the response headers.

Open Burp Suite, then activate foxyproxy in your browser and refresh the page. Now go to "Proxy" in Burp Suite and find "HTTP History". Find the request to /http and read the headers.
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Server: gunicorn
Date: Mon, 08 Apr 2024 13:22:43 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 5959
Kode: 991859
```
Enter the value of the "kode" header into the website to continue.
## Challenge 2
In this challenge, our browser sends 100 requests and we need to find the one with the 'Kode-Sok' response header. In HTTP history in Burp Suite, click the filter to search for 'Kode-Sok:', and one single request should show up. It's important to search for 'Kode-Sok:' with the colon at the end, as opposed to just 'Kode-Sok', since every request contains that term when describing what you should be looking for.

After searching, this request comes up:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Server: gunicorn
Date: Mon, 08 Apr 2024 13:31:09 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 8
Kode-Sok: 520319
```
Enter the value of the 'Kode-Sok' header into the website to continue.
## Challenge 3
This challenge wants us to use the "Repeater" function in Burp, but i found it much simpler to just use intercept. I will demonstrate both solutions.

The challenge gives us a text field conatining the number 12345, and a button that makes a POST request to this website with that value. We can't change the value on the website, but we can change it in the request.

Click "GÃ¥ videre!" and find the POST request in HTTP history, press Ctrl+R and go to the "Repeater" tab. Here you can send the same request mulitple times with small modifiactions to see the different responses. Change the value of "12345" at the bottom of the request to whatever your code was
